# 🌌 Cosmic Classifier

This project builds a robust multi-model classification pipeline to identify types of planets based on various environmental, astronomical, and physical features. It employs XGBoost, CatBoost, and Deep Neural Networks, and combines them using an ensemble approach with majority voting for improved accuracy.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Numeric extraction from text-based columns (`Magnetic Field Strength`, `Radiation Levels`)
  - Removal of invalid entries and extreme outliers
  - Missing value imputation using **Bayesian Ridge Regression**
  - Label encoding for categorical data

- ⚙️ **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  - **XGBoost Classifier**
  - **CatBoost Classifier**
  - **Deep Neural Network** (TensorFlow + Keras)
  - Stratified 5-fold cross-validation
  - Ensemble through **majority voting**

- 🧪 **Model Export & Inference**  
  - All trained models saved for production use
  - Includes preprocessing artifacts (`LabelEncoder`, `Scaler`, `Imputer`)
  - Predict pipeline for testing on unseen data

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost catboost tensorflow scikit-learn joblib
```

## 🧪 Run Inference

To predict new data using the trained models:

```python
from main import predict_test_data

# Replace with your test CSV path
predict_test_data("path_to_test_file.csv")
```

## 🧠 Model Details

- **XGBoost**:
  - 1500 trees, depth=9, learning_rate=0.02
- **CatBoost**:
  - 1000 iterations, depth=8, learning_rate=0.05
- **DNN**:
  - Layers: [512, 256, 128], BatchNorm & Dropout applied

## 📌 Notes

- All models were trained on scaled and imputed data.
- `IterativeImputer` with `BayesianRidge` was used to preserve statistical properties during imputation.
- Saved artifacts ensure consistent preprocessing during test-time inference.
